Hello, my name is Miguel. I am a biologist with great interest in understanding 
life from a quantitative and systematic perspective. My current efforts are 
focused on advancing the understanding of RNA modifications, working in the 
development of technologies to detect and quantify different moieties across 
whole transcriptomes. 

I am currently an academic collaborator at the [Schwartz Lab](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/Schwartz/) 
of the Weizmann Institute of Science, from which I recently graduated as a PhD 
and I am looking for a prospective lab to continue my work as a postdoctoral 
fellow.

In the Schwartz lab, we work in the field of Epitranscriptomics, a 
booming research field that deals with the biochemical modifications 
of RNA molecules of all living organisms and even viruses. My previous work 
revolved around [N6-methyladenosine (m6A)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N6-Methyladenosine).
m6A is a highly abundant mRNA modification present in all eukaryotes, 
and it has recently received attention as a potential therapeutic target for 
treating diseases such as Cancer, Osteoporosis, Obesity, and Diabetes. 
At the SchwartzLab, we developed [a methodology](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30676-2), 
that is able to detect and quantify m6A in a high-throughput, 
single-nucleotide, and antibody-independent manner. Using this new technology 
we uncovered a code that dictates m6A deposition across the transcriptomes of 
mouse and yeast, one of our main conclusions is that m6A deposition is strongly 
coded in the RNA sequence of each gene.
