excerpt: "Pan-Mod-seq enables high-throughput profiling of 16 rRNA modifications across diverse species, revealing that while these chemical markers are largely static in mesophiles, they are highly dynamic in hyperthermophiles. Specifically, a conserved m<sup>5</sup>C-ac<sup>4</sup>C module is co-induced by heat and serves a critical role in stabilizing ribosome structure at extreme temperatures. Cryo-EM and biophysical analyses confirm that this modification module provides essential thermostability required for hyperthermophilic growth.

Highlights
==========
- Pan-Mod-seq profiles 16 rRNA modifications across dozens of samples in parallel
- rRNA modifications are largely static in mesophiles but dynamic in hyperthermophiles
- A conserved m5C-ac4C module is co-induced by heat and required for thermophilic growth
- Cryo-EM and biophysics reveal this module stabilizes ribosomes at high temperatures

Abstract
==========
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) constitutes the core of ribosomes and is extensively chemically modified. Technical challenges have precluded systematically dissecting rRNA modifications and their dynamics. We develop Pan-Mod-seq, permitting inference of 16 distinct modifications across dozens of samples in parallel. We applied Pan-Mod-seq to RNA from 14 species spanning all domains of life, cultured under highly diverse conditions. While dynamic modifications are rare in mesophiles, in extreme hyperthermophiles, ∼50% of modifications are dynamic. We dissect the biogenesis and function of a conserved module of tandem m5C-ac4C modifications, co-induced at high temperatures, via enzymes intrinsically regulated by temperature and required for growth at higher temperatures. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ribosomes from wild-type (WT) and enzyme-deficient archaea reveal recurrent molecular interactions through which they confer structural stability, and biophysical studies demonstrate their synergistic thermostabilizing role. Our findings systematically dissect rRNA modification plasticity and pave the way for surveying the rRNA epitranscriptome in health and disease.
