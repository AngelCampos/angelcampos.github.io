excerpt: "eLife assessment: This study presents a fundamental finding on how levels of m6A levels are controlled, invoking a consolidated model where degradation of modified RNAs in the cytoplasm plays a primary role in shaping m6A patterns and dynamics, rather than needing active regulation by m6A erasers and other related processes. The evidence is compelling through its use of transcriptome-wide data and mechanistic modeling. Relevant for any reader with an interest in RNA metabolism, this new framework consolidates previous observations and highlights the importance of careful experimentation for evaluation m6A levels.

Abstract
==========
m6A is the most widespread mRNA modification and is primarily implicated in controlling mRNA stability. Fundamental questions pertaining to m6A are the extent to which it is dynamically modulated within cells and across stimuli, and the forces underlying such modulation. Prior work has focused on investigating active mechanisms governing m6A levels, such as recruitment of m6A writers or erasers leading to either ‘global’ or ‘site-specific’ modulation. Here, we propose that changes in m6A levels across subcellular compartments and biological trajectories may result from passive changes in gene-level mRNA metabolism. To predict the intricate interdependencies between m6A levels, mRNA localization, and mRNA decay, we establish a differential model ‘m6ADyn’ encompassing mRNA transcription, methylation, export, and m6A-dependent and -independent degradation. We validate the predictions of m6ADyn in the context of intracellular m6A dynamics, where m6ADyn predicts associations between relative mRNA localization and m6A levels, which we experimentally confirm. We further explore m6ADyn predictions pertaining to changes in m6A levels upon controlled perturbations of mRNA metabolism, which we also experimentally confirm. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of m6ADyn in the context of cellular heat stress response, where genes subjected to altered mRNA product and export also display predictable changes in m6A levels, consistent with m6ADyn predictions. Our findings establish a framework for dissecting m6A dynamics and suggest the role of passive dynamics in shaping m6A levels in mammalian systems.
